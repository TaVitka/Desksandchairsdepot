          services. Some of the information we collect is directly from you via

          <li>Run and operate the website and Services</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with
          the website and Services, where you are located in the world and if
          one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one
          or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the
          processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer
          Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of
          information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you
          and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing
          is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are
          subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in
          the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
          us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
          interests pursued by us or by a third party.

          information until you object to such processing (by opting out),
          without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal
          bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific
          legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether
          the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual
          requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

          maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records
          for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our
          affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you

          These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your
          information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or
          comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information
          for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are
          consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with
          respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given

          designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose
          Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive
          if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or
          similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that
          disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or
          the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government
          request.

          assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be
          among the assets transferred.

        <h2>Retention of information</h2>
        <p>
          We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
          necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
          enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or
          permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or
          incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it,
          but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the
          retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
          rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
          after the expiration of the retention period.
