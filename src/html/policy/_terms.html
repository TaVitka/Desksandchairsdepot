          purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Site, provided that they each

        <p>
          In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users of
          the Site (including, without limitation, any dispute between any
          Provider and Prospect regarding any transaction), you hereby agree to
          release, remise and forever discharge the site and each member of the
          Desks and Chairs Depot, each of their respective agents, directors,
          officers, members, managers, employees, successors and all other
          related persons or entities from any and all manner of rights, claims,
          complaints, suits, demands, causes of action, proceedings,
          liabilities, obligations, legal fees, costs, and disbursements of any
          nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, which now or hereafter
          arise from, relate to, or are connected with such dispute and/or your
          use of the Sites or the service. If you are a California resident, you
          waive California civil code section 1542, which says: “a general
          release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
          suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the
          release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected
          his or her settlement with the debtor” (or any equivalent statutory
          provision with a similar import or intent). If you are a resident of a
          state other than California, you explicitly waive the terms and
          protections of any statute of your own state that has a similar import
